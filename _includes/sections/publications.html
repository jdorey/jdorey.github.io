        <h2><strong>What I have learned</strong></h2>
        As the son of an entrepreneur, I know what it means to have pride in an organization that you are an integral part of. While coding at a start-up company, I learned not only discipline, but also the joy of seeing my contribution positively impact the
progression of the product. I love a challenge and my experience in the building of a successful multinational business has helped me develop many valuable skills within
the technology sector. I have also gained a strong set of non-technical skills through my work in catering. I am eager to learn and grow, while being able to fully utilize the experience I have for your business.

        While I am always working on building to broaden my skill set. I believe that a healthy lifestyle out of work is needed as well.

        <h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
        Throughout the years music has been a big part of my life. From the begining of playing guitar in our Church's youth group to later playing bass in a country band. <br />
        Noteable achievement is being a 4 Time Arkansas Country Music Awards Winner

        <h2><strong>Disc Golf</strong></h2>
        Since the pandemic, my friends and I were looking for a new way to spend time together and has been a blast ever since. Arkansas has a great scene and we are lucky to have so many courses to pick from within a short distance.
